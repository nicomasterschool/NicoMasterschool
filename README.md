## Hi there, I'm Nico Masterschool A.k.A @DataDrivenNic 👋

👀 I’m passionate about turning raw data into valuable insights and solutions for businesses.

🌱 I’m a Data Analyst with expertise in SQL, Python, and data visualization tools.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving PYTHON, SQL, EXCEL, and VISUALIZATION with tools like POWER BI, LOOKER, or TABLEAU.

👨‍💻 In my free time, I enjoy helping other data enthusiasts refine their analytics and solve complex problems.

🌱 Here on GitHub, you’ll find a [collection of projects] (https://github.com/nicomasterschool/Data-Analytics-Portfolio) that highlight my journey in data analysis. Let’s connect and turn data into action!
